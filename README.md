Human liver meta-analysis project. 


TODOs:
- validation data?
- clean up pre-processing code
  - add in more stopifnots, etc to make sure mapping is good
  - more tidyverse!
- platform gene-name synonyms - I think we're not as up to date as we could be
- double check on the one-to-many + many-to-many
- clean up utils
- how many of the packages do we actually need
- add readmes for data directories - what data is here? how did we get it?

- first study?
- studies with n=4, n=6... what to do?

- obesity studies...

- apply to drug-labeled data
